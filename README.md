# fixing-git-mistakes

## Setup

Before the workshop, do the following:

### Clone this repository.  

It doesn't have much in it yet, but we will be building it up during the workshop.

### Create a new repository on your own GitHub account

This is the repo you will use during the workshop - just for you.

This can be a private repo, and you could use gitlab (etc) if you're more comfortable with that.

If you've never done that before, here are the steps to follow:

1. Sign up for github if you don't already have an account

2. In the upper left, next to "Repositories", click "New"

3. Give your repository a name - it doesn't matter what it is, only you will see it

4. Mark the repo as "private" if you'd like, or keep it public - it doesn't matter for this workshop

5. Click to create the repo

6. Navigate to the new repo, and click "Clone or download"

7. Copy the git or https address, and then in a terminal run:

> git clone [address]

If that works - you're good to go!

If it doesn't work, let me know and I'll help you work through it


## What we'll do during the workshop

Throughout the workshop, we'll be using that github repo you just created.  We'll add files, make commits, and push to github.

We'll also purposefully mess things up!  

Then we'll see what went wrong, and how to fix it.


## After the workshop

Afterwards, you'll have a better understanding of all the different ways a file can exist in git. 

You'll be able to handle it when mistakes happen - without worrying about losing data, or messing up other people's repos. ðŸŽ‰
